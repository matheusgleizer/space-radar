##### This is a project written in React and Node.js. It fetches and displays data provided by a third-party API using GraphQL as a query language.

##### The filters are used to write the queries, so when a filter is checked/unchecked the app re-fetches the data using a new query generated in the frontend.

##### An express server is responsible to receive requests from the frontend, fetch the data provided by the third-party API and send back a response to the frontend with the data fetched.

##### The objective of this project is to put into practice concepts in React, Node.js and GraphQL. Styled-components were used in order to make the code more readable, although the style is quite simple and not much effort has been put into improving it.

##### The GraphQL API can be accessed via the link https://api.spacex.land/graphql/.
